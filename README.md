# Melanoma Detection Using CNN

This project is a web-based application that uses a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify skin lesion images as **Benign** or **Malignant Melanoma**. It leverages a deep learning model trained on image data and integrates Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for model hosting.
