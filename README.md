# Melanoma Detection Using CNN

This project is a web-based application that uses a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify skin lesion images as **Benign** or **Malignant Melanoma**. It leverages a deep learning model trained on image data and integrates Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for model hosting.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Locally

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manisankar29/Melanoma_Prediction_Using_CNN.git
cd Melanoma_Prediction_Using_CNN
```

2. Set up virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Add your GCS key

Update the path in `app.py` with the correct location of your `gcs-key.json`

5. Run the app

```bash
python app.py
```
Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

```bash
‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: The CNN model file (`skin.h5`) is not included in this repository due to file size limitations.

To run the project locally, you must have access to the trained model file and place it in the appropriate location as expected by the app.

You can either:
- Modify the code to use your own model path.
- Request access to the model by contacting the project maintainer via 
```

## üê≥ Deployment Notes

- Model is large, so use cloud storage for hosting
- Free hosting platforms like **Render** or **Railway** may timeout on heavy model loading
- Consider using **Gunicorn** for production
- Use environment variables for secrets like GCS keys
